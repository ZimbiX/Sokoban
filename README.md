# Sokoban

This is my implementation of the classic box movement puzzle, [Sokoban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban). Here's an animation showing how it works:

Currently a work in progress. Initially, there will be a command-line ASCII interface, but I plan to also create a graphical alternative.

## Getting started

### Setup

Install all the required gems:

	bundle install

### Play

Once you're set up, run:

    ruby sokoban.rb

## Run the specs

If you feel like it, you can test the code against the specs by running `guard` and pressing Enter.

## What's next

I'd like to reuse this codebase to create another game called [Chip's Challenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%27s_Challenge).
